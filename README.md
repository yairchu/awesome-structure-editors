## Foreword

Projectional editing is how almost all document editing applications work nowadays, except for editing source code and text documents, where it is still common to edit plain text files that are parsed to render/compile the result.

This document is a list of projects trying to bring the projectional/structural approach to source code editing.

As evident from the wealth of ongoing and concluded attempts listed below, this problem appears to be either difficult, or impossible. Hopefully one or more of these projects will succeed in realising it and bringing it to the mainstream!

## Structural code editor projects

This list includes projects which are actively developed or were maintained recently. Currently the bar for incomplete projects is set arbitrarily at 2020.

Project properties are summarized using unicode/emoji "flags":
- Project structure: 💵 Commercial, 🎓 Academic, ♡ Accepts donations
- UX: 📖 Uses text files, ⤴️ Visual programming, ⌨️ Text editing like UX
- Target languages: 👶 New language, λ Functional, ｟ Lisp-based, ☕ JavaScript/TypeScript, 🧰 Language Workbench
- Other: 🔨 Is in some production use, 🌐 Works in browser, 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Not intended for programmers, 文 Localization support

### Concluded or inactive projects

| Project | Time_Period | Properties | Description
|--------:|:------:|:----------:|:------------
| [Inflex](https://chrisdone.com/posts/inflex/) | 2020 - 2022 | 💵 🌐 👶 λ | A spreadsheet-inspired functional programming language
| [Intentional software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_Software) | 1990s - 2017 | 💵 | Started as a Microsoft project to develop a projectional editor in the late 1990s (see [video from 2000](https://youtu.be/tSnnfUj1XCQ)), which later spun up as an independent company, which later pivoted to develop a language workbench. Despite being founded and self-funded by [a Billionaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Simonyi), it was ultimately acquired by Microsoft at 2017, with the original projects being cancelled (afaik).
| [Eve](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/eve/) | 2014 - 2018 | 💵 👶 | A startup that made a series of experimental programming systems and was shut down in 2018.
| [Prune](https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/634802168508235777) | 2015 | | An internal research project in Facebook. Concluded in it "being promising" but according to them "programmers don't spend that much time manipulating programs compared to all the other things they do. Enabling programmers to do a 50% better job of a task requiring 10% of their time just doesn't make economic sense" (redacted quote).
| [Novella](https://github.com/chrisdone/novella) | 2019 - 2020 | | A structural editor infrastructure, in 2020 author moved on to develop Inflex instead.

## Blocks Programming Editors

Blocks Programming languages/editors are a specific kind of structural programming editors,
where the code is structured in a manner similar to "lego blocks" supporting "drag and drop" editing.
