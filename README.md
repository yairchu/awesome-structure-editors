# Awesome Structure Editors [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A list of structural/projectional code editor projects.

Any comments, suggestions? [Let us know!](https://github.com/yairchu/awesome-structure-editors/issues)

## Foreword

Projectional editing is how almost all document editing applications work nowadays, except for editing source code and text documents, where it is still common to edit plain text files that are parsed to render/compile the result.

This document is a list of projects trying to bring the projectional/structural approach to source code editing.

As evident from the wealth of ongoing and concluded attempts listed below, this problem appears to be either difficult, or impossible. Hopefully one or more of these projects will succeed in realising it and bringing it to the mainstream!

### Unreleased Projects

* [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org) - A performance oriented functional programming language [with a structural editor](https://youtu.be/ZnYa99QoznE?t=5864)
* [SplootCode](https://splootcode.io) - A structural editor for Python, aimed towards beginners
* [Dion Systems](https://dion.systems)
* [Programming with Plain Words](https://www.patreon.com/posts/screenshot-with-14865073) - An educational editor for a structured English-like language. No update since 2017 afaik

### Concluded or inactive projects

* [Intentional software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_Software) (1990s - 2017) started as a Microsoft project to develop a projectional editor in the late 1990s (see [video from 2000](https://youtu.be/tSnnfUj1XCQ)), which later spun up as an independent company, which later pivoted to develop a language workbench. Despite being founded and self-funded by [a Billionaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Simonyi), it was ultimately acquired by Microsoft at 2017, with the original projects being cancelled (afaik).
* [Eve](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/eve/) (2014 - 2018) was a startup that made a series of experimental programming systems and was shut down in 2018.
* [Prune](https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/634802168508235777) (2015) was an internal research project in Facebook. Concluded in it being promising but according to them "programmers don't spend that much time manipulating programs compared to all the other things they do ... enabling ... programmers to do a 50% better job ... of a task requiring 10% of their time just doesn't make economic sense"
* [Isomorf](https://isomorf.io/#!/) is a startup developing an in-browser editor for a language that can appear in a syntax of the user's choosing among a few options appearing like different popular programming language. No updates since 2017?
* [Omni](https://github.com/daniel-kun/omni) was declared as on-hold since 2017
* [Zinal](https://gitlab.com/nickcollins/zinal) last updated in 2017

### Blocks Programming Editors

Blocks Programming languages/editors are a specific kind of structural programming editors,
where the code is structured in a manner similar to "lego blocks" supporting "drag and drop" editing.
